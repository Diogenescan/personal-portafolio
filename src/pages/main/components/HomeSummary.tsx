                    I have been diligently studying and working in the fields of mathematics and statistics for over five years.
                    Delved into statistics to enrich my understanding of quantum mechanics,
                    which further led me to explore the exciting field of data science.

                    In my career, I have developed algorithms and models that significantly bolstered the revenue of the companies I have been part of.
                    Tackled commercial projects, such as building churn/retention models, as well as larger-scale endeavors.
                    Notably, I developed models where I served as a specialized data scientist in fraud detection.

                    I have also worked as a full-stack software engineer. In this role,
                    I developed web platforms that leverage data science to enhance the efficiency of tasks that otherwise would be highly time-consuming.
                    Using tools like graph theory, machine learning and data validation to government-level standards.
