                            have been diligently studying and working in the fields of mathematics and statistics for over five years.
                            I delved into statistics to enrich my understanding of quantum mechanics,
                            which further led me to explore the exciting field of data science.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In my career, I have developed algorithms and models that significantly bolstered the revenue of the companies I have been part of.
                            I have tackled commercial projects, such as building churn/retention models, as well as larger-scale endeavors.
                            Notably, I developed models where I served as a specialized data scientist in fraud detection.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I have also worked as a full-stack software engineer. In this role,
                            I developed web platforms that leverage data science to enhance the efficiency of tasks that otherwise would be highly time-consuming.
                            I used tools like graph theory, machine learning and data validation to government-level standards.
